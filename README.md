# OpenSystem-tDMRG
In this repository we share the program used to generate the data for the paper entitled "Efficient quantum information probes of non-equilibrium quantum criticality". The paper can be found at  and preprint version at .

This program uses Matrix Product State techniques to otbain the steady-states of Markovian open quantum systems. The MPS implementation is based on teh ITensor library.

## Running code for chain


## Running code for ladder






run code for chain
./XXZ_sim 6 64 0.25 0.1 10000 0.05 50 0 16 0.25 0.1



run code for ladder
./FermionLadder_sim 3 16 1.5 0.1 10000 0.05 50 0 16 0


Explain general way of running the code; explain inputs one by one for chain and ladder

Explain how ID is assigned 

Benchmark section
give some inputs and then say that the user should be able to replicate the simple results in the Mathematica files.
