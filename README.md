Code for paper "Efficient quantum information probes of non-equilibrium quantum criticality"

run code for chain
./XXZ_sim 6 64 0.25 0.1 10000 0.05 50 0 16 0.25 0.1



run code for ladder
./FermionLadder_sim 3 16 1.5 0.1 10000 0.05 50 0 16 0


Explain general way of running the code; explain inputs one by one for chain and ladder

Explain how ID is assigned 

Benchmark section
give some inputs and then say that the user should be able to replicate the simple results in the Mathematica files.
